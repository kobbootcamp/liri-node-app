The application is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.  
The user has the choice of the following:
"concert-this": enter an artist or band and see when they are performing next using bandsintown API.
"spotify-this-song": enter a song title to search the spotify database.
"movie-this": enter a movie title and see information about that movie from OMDB API.
"do-what-it-says": read the contents of a file (random.txt) file and follow those choices.

I've add a twist that the songs can be played and movie posters can be viewed.
